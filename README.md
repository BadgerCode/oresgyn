Entree in the Garry's Mod Gamemode Competition 2017.<br>
[Get it on the Steam Workshop](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1101649274).

## Overview
This is a real-time strategy game where players must fight to take control of the map.<br>
Players can purchase defensive towers with **space** and speed upgrades with **e**.

Tiles will contribute money to your economy but upgrades will drain it.

* Tiles gain £1 per finance tick
* Towers cost £20 initially and £15 per finance tick
* Speed upgrades cost £20 per level and £3 per finance tick per level

Rounds will last for 3 minutes max.

This should be played on **gm_flatgrass**.

The competition lasted for around 7 weeks. Due to other time commitments, I was only able to work on this for 1 week and only in the evenings.

The gamemode came 12th out of 19 gamemodes.
